## USAGE
Clone the scripts within this repository into your PATH and make sure the files have the necessary permissions for execution.

I highly advise that you carefully read the code of any scripts you plan to use, to understand at least the basics of how
they function before you ever try to run them on your system.

### POSIX
Most of these scripts try to follow POSIX compliancy, are tested on Arch Linux using Dash (Debian Almquist Shell),
and state their dependencies in their documentation.

### DOCUMENTATION
At the top each script file is located a comment block that provides basic necessary information for using said script.
This same comment block may also be viewed as a help message using the `-h` flag with any of the scripts.

Additional comments may appear within the files for added context and reasoning,
for those looking to adapt these scripts to their workflow.
